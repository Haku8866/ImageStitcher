# ImageStitcher
When taking large Terraria captures, you can either turn "image packing" on to produce a single low-quality image, or you can leave it off to produce a folder containing several chunks of the full screenshot without any quality loss. This tool will take all those smaller chunks and stitch them together into one large full-quality image.
# How to use
Simply move the ImageStitcher.exe file into the same folder as the images you want to stitch and double click it to run the script.
# Note
Do not run this program in your "Terraria/Captures" folder, you must run it in the "Terraria\Captures\Capture YYYY-MM-DD HH_MM_SS" folder, where Y, M, D, H, M, and S are numbers representing the date and time the capture was taken.
